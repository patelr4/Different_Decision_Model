Excel contains different models. 
#########################################Decision Models â€“ Outsourcing######################################################
Decision modeling is used to analyze or facilitate making a decision
Outsourcing Model
Model components
F = fixed cost of in-house manufacturing
V = unit variable cost of in-house manufacturing
C = unit cost of outsourcing
D = demand volume
Total Manufacturing Cost = TMC = F + V * D
Total outsourcing cost = TOC = C * D
#########################################Airline Pricing Model###########################################################
Build Pricing Model based on what-if analysis using excel diferent tool like scenario manager and goal seek
Using Scenario Manager, we can evaluate business condition in  3 scenarios; Best Case/Worst Case/ Most Likely Case.
Goal seek is  used to get desired output based on assumption.It works on trial and error approach  to solve the problems. 
It will keep plugging different assumption until it finds the desired soultion.
########################################Monte Carlo Simulation##############################################################
The process of generating random values foruncertain inputs in a model, computing the output variables of interest, and repeating
this process for many trials in order to understand the distribution of the output results
